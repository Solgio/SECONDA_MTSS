The project is developed using **TDD** for the two principal classes. All the tests are made using *ArrangeActAssert* and following the *JUnit* standard, making sure that the tests are expressive, simple to read and compact. All this results in code that should follow the *A-Trip* and *Right Bicep* standard.

The tests cover all the lines and uses *Coveralls* to check the overall coverage for the develop and main branches.

The *Checkstyle* default values has been modified with reasonable values (50 for method lenght for example).
